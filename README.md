# Data Structures and Algorithms Topics

This repository contains implementations and explanations of various data structures and algorithms.

## Data Structures

### Skip List

- [ ] Implement a skip list in `C++`, using templates to support different data types.
- [ ] Initialize the skip list with a given array of elements.
- [ ] Insert a new element into the skip list.
- [ ] Delete an element from the skip list.
- [ ] Search for an element in the skip list.

### Geohash

- [ ] Use base 32 characters to encode a latitude and longitude pair into a geohash string.
- [ ] Decode a geohash string into a latitude and longitude pair.
- [ ] Find bounds and adjacent geohashes from strings.

## Algorithms

- [ ] Add sorting algorithms (e.g., quicksort, mergesort).
- [ ] Implement search algorithms (e.g., binary search, depth-first search).
- [ ] Explore dynamic programming techniques.
